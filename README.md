DotNetify makes it super easy to connect your React Native mobile app to a cross-platform .NET back-end and get real-time two-way communication with WebSockets for free!

### Demo Features

- Reactive push model allows for a very light-weight client. No need to set up REST or GraphQL calls; state change can cause new data to be pushed directly into the component's state.
- Token-based authentication over websocket communications with expiration handling.
- Infinite list scrolling.
- Live data display for IoT use cases.
- Connection error handling.
- Using react-navigation with custom logic to track active screen.
